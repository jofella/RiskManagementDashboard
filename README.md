# Risk Management Dashboard

This project is part of a university course on Risk Management.  
It aims to review theoretical concepts and demonstrate how they can be visualized interactively using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Project Goals

- Review and apply key concepts from the Risk Management lecture
- Develop an interactive educational dashboard using Python and Streamlit

## Features

- Visual explanation of risk types and measures (e.g. Value at Risk)
- Integration of example data sets
- Modular codebase with clear structure for frontend/backend

## Folder Structure

- `Sources/`: Core modules and data processing scripts  
- `pages/`: Multi-page Streamlit views  
- `util/`: Helper functions  
- `data/`: Sample or generated input data  
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the dashboard  
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies  
- `structure_idea.png`: Initial concept diagram

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
