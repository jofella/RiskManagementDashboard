# 📊 Risk Management Dashboard

This project was developed during my master’s studies as part of a **Risk Management** course.  
It serves both as a review of theoretical concepts and an exercise in building interactive dashboards with **Streamlit**.  
It is also my **first application-oriented project** using Streamlit and modular Python structuring.

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Risk Management Dashboard** is an educational, interactive application designed to make abstract financial risk models more tangible through visualization and simulation.

Originally conceived during coursework, the project focuses on:

- Translating theoretical risk management concepts into a functional analytical tool  
- Presenting financial risk measures through interactive visualizations  
- Demonstrating clean, modular Python project structuring  

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Theoretical Application**  
  Implement core concepts from risk management lectures (e.g., Value at Risk)

- **Software Engineering**  
  Build a modular, maintainable codebase with clear separation between analytical logic and frontend presentation

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Interactive visual explanation of risk types and measures (e.g., **Value at Risk**)  
- Integration of example financial datasets  
- Modular backend/frontend architecture  
- Multi-page Streamlit interface for structured exploration
