# Risk Management Dashboard

> This project was developed during my master's studies as part of a course on Risk Management.  
> It serves both as a review of theoretical concepts and an exercise in building interactive dashboards with Streamlit.  
> This is also my **first application-oriented project** using Streamlit and modular Python structuring.

This project aims to review core concepts of risk management and present them in an educational, interactive way using [Streamlit] - Here you can find dashboard: (https://riskmanagementdashboard-ahcrwbuaieyzxu4hvzryih.streamlit.app/Explore_Data).

## Project Overview
This dashboard serves as a comprehensive review of risk management concepts. Originally conceived during my Master’s studies, it focuses on making abstract financial models tangible through interactive data visualization and modular Python architecture.

Key Objectives:
Theoretical Application: Implementing core concepts from Risk Management lectures into a functional tool.

Engineering: Building a "production-ready" modular codebase with a clear separation between analytical logic and frontend presentation.

## Features

- Visual explanation of risk types and measures (e.g. Value at Risk)
- Integration of example data sets
- Modular codebase with clear structure for frontend/backend

## Folder Structure

- `Sources/`: Core modules and data processing scripts  
- `pages/`: Multi-page Streamlit views  
- `util/`: Helper functions  
- `data/`: Sample or generated input data  
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the dashboard  
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies  
- `structure_idea.png`: Initial concept diagram

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
