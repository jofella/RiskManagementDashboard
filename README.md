# Risk Management Dashboard

> This project was developed during my master's studies as part of a course on Risk Management.  
> It serves both as a review of theoretical concepts and an exercise in building interactive dashboards with Streamlit.

This project aims to review core concepts of risk management and present them in an educational, interactive way using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).


## Project Goals

- Review and apply key concepts from the Risk Management lecture
- Develop an interactive educational dashboard using Python and Streamlit

## Features

- Visual explanation of risk types and measures (e.g. Value at Risk)
- Integration of example data sets
- Modular codebase with clear structure for frontend/backend

## Folder Structure

- `Sources/`: Core modules and data processing scripts  
- `pages/`: Multi-page Streamlit views  
- `util/`: Helper functions  
- `data/`: Sample or generated input data  
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the dashboard  
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies  
- `structure_idea.png`: Initial concept diagram

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
